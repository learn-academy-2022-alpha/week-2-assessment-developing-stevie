# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer:

Argument - 
  The value inside of the parentheses after a built in method.

Parameter -
A variable outside of a function, that sets a limit for funtion to use or carries the data on.
  
  Researched answer:

Argument - The value that is passed through fruntions with a parameter.

Parameter - A special variable that is used, to carry information between functions.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: 

  .map() takes an array that you provide it, with the code that you make. It then forms an array un-changed, with the new values in it. It must use objects and values to make a key. It will always return a key, but if you use objects or values is dependent on the task at hand.

  Researched answer:

  .map() iterates an array, then gives a new array with the same length. It is used to help shorten code while converting values to keys. The array can be called on in any manner.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: 
  
  .filter() does exactly that filter out things, from an array that you have asked it to do so.

  Researched answer:

  .filter() uses a function to return an array with new values that are only truthy or suit the conditions stated.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: 
  
  Function -
  A function is type of code. That takes the code between the curly braces -> { } , the funtion and makes it complete an action. This action or "function" allows you to call on the section in the curly braces. Calling on the function allows you, to set many ways and reasons to run that set of code. For the fuction to act on the intructions it is given inside the code, it needs to be called on and defined clearly.

  Method -
  A method is a built in operator or mutator line of code that, preforms a specific action on diffrent areas of code constantly. A method is a code that is inserted into an exisiting or new section of code. Usually used with an array to make it act in a predetermened manor, depending on the way you use it.

  Researched answer:
  
  Method - A funtionality that is added to a code to a common task. Used commonly, on arrays to help access or modify content. Some need more information, to act as needed by putting information into the parentheses.

  Function -
  A reusable piece of code that is executable by invoking it. It uses paramaters and placeholder to pass information through itself. They are used many times in just a single program and should be generic as possible but be very descriptive.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:
   
   Destructuring an object is a way to assign variables, in an array sort of like classes.

  Researched answer: 
   
   Destructuring is a special way of assigning variables in javascript. This allows you to take an array of object and present them as individial variables.Taking the properties of an object, then breaking them down to be called on individually.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance:

Is much like filter() or .map() it allows you, to use similar built in functions. Such as render() in react to get the soultion you are trying to achive.

2. React: 

A langauge created by facebook used to build, many websites and applications it is based on components.

3. React state:

An object used in react, to update class methods and changes what appears in the browser

4. React lifecycle methods:

A build in method that uses components, like class inheritance. It goes through a cyle of birth, growing, and death each component has a lifecycle.

5. DOM:

Document object model is an interterface, that acts as if html is a tree structure.
